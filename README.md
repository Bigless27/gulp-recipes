Not your typical collection of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) recipes.

Rather than having a big 'ol ```gulpfile.js``` with a ton of ```gulp.tasks()```, each recipe is a standalone folder that comes along with real examples that you can ```gulp``` to see it in action, along with comprehensive ```README.md```.

Simply ```cd``` to a recipe folder, ```gulp``` and slurp away.


## Quick Start

### Pre-requisites

```bash
npm install -g gulp
```

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sogko/gulp-recipes
cd gulp-recipes

npm  install
```

### Running a recipe example

For eg: [```expressjs-browser-sync-nodemon```](expressjs-browser-sync-nodemon)

```bash
cd expressjs-browser-sync-nodemon

gulp
```
